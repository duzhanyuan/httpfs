# httpfs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/prologic/httpfs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/prologic/httpfs)

httpfs is a cross-platform HTTP backed File System implemented using FUSE.
It provides a backend API over HTTP/HTTPS to provide most POSIX file system
calls for a FUSE frontend that presents this API as what looks and feels like
a regular file system.

## Installation

### Source

```#!bash
$ go install github.com/prologic/httpfs/...
```

### OS X Homebrew

```#!bash
$ brew tap prologic/httpfs
$ brew install --HEAD httpfs
```

httpfs is still early days so contributions, ideas and expertise are
much appreciated and highly welome!

## Other Platforms

Please note that at this time (30th November 2016) httpfs is only supported
and tested on Mac OS X with Homebrew installed Go 1.7 and a recent version of
bazil.org/fuse

In theory it should be possible to build httpfs for other platforms as long
as you meet the following requirements:

- Go 1.7+
- FUSE / OSXFUSE

## Usage

Spin up the backend:

```#!bash
$ httpfs -root /path/to/dir
```

Mount it:
```#!bash
$ httpfsmount -url http://localhost:8000 -mount /path/to/mountpoint
```

Then use /path/to/mountpoint as a regular file system!
